## Usage
---

### Posts
> Every time you see Post::method(), if you're using your own Post class (where you set the connection name), like App\Post you should use App\Post::method() and not Post::method(). All the examples are assuming you already know this difference.

```php
// All published posts
$posts = Post::published()->get();
$posts = Post::status('publish')->get();

// A specific post
$post = Post::find(31);
echo $post->post_title;

// Filter by meta/custom field
$posts = Post::published()->hasMeta('field')->get();
$posts = Post::hasMeta('acf')->get();
```

### Pages
> Pages are like custom post types. You can use Post::type('page') or the Page class.

```php
// Find a page by slug
$page = Page::slug('about')->first(); // OR
$page = Post::type('page')->slug('about')->first();
echo $page->post_title;
```

For documentation please visit [jgrossi/corcel](https://github.com/corcel/corcel#usage) for Corcel's usage and then come back here for how to use wpml plugin.

### Translations
> By using the `$post` object, we can access to the translation created by WPML.

Instead of using `Corcel\Post`, we use `Wpml\Post` to Override few variables.

```php
// Find a post by id
$post = Post::find(31);

// Language variable
$lang = 'en'; // OR
$lang = 'zh';

echo $post->wpml->translate->$lang->post_title;
```
